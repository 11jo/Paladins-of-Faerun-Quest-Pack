Paladins of Faerûn Quest Pack for Baldur's Gate II: EE and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).


**[BP-BGT Worldmap is required !](https://github.com/SpellholdStudios/BP-BGT-Worldmap)**


## Description


Paladins of Faerûn Quest Pack is a WeiDU adaptation of the total conversion of Paladins of Faerûn from BGslayer and other Czech developers, and contains only the quests of the original Paladins of Faerûn.
In Weidu, the mod format was translated by Gorion and Serdrick. Paladins of Faerûn Quest Pack contains all the quests of the original Paladins of Faerun mod, but it is not an exact copy of it. Certain parts of the quests were implemented differently. A large number of errors were also corrected, many scripts and dialogs were rewritten practically as new.


**This particular version try to adapt the mod to Enhanced Editions and preserve vanilla compatibility.**


## Installation


Standard for WeiDU mods. Unzip the contents of the archive into the directory with the game, and run SETUP-PoFQuestPack.exe.
After installing the mod, be sure to install the [BP-BGT-Worlmap mod](https://github.com/SpellholdStudios/BP-BGT-Worldmap/releases), required to access new areas.


## Compatibility



PoFQuestPack is implemented in WeiDU format and should be compatible with other WeiDU mods. If you find any errors, please report them to the mod support forum:

## Content


The mod contains with itself a large main quest "Paladins of Faerûn", two side quests "Order and Chaos" and "Abduction and Politics".

- New adventures in the cities are also waiting for you : Neverwinter, Baldur's Gate, Waterdeep, Targos (city center, docks), Siluvaned (Elven city) and Har Al-Dur (city of priests) 

- Each of them has its own city quest, mainly to provide any help to the city or even save it.

- In addition, there are more than 20 separate small quests.

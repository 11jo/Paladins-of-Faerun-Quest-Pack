@1 = ~ I know you, you were already here ... Yes, right, you helped us when we were attacked by Luskan. What brings you here again? Nivall, who are these attackers? ~
@2 = ~ Lord, these attackers are called southerners, they came from distant Erlkazur and leads their fierce lord named Gradak. He chose your city as a strategic goal. If the city is conquered, they will be able to further attack cities such as Deep Water, Luskan and many others. We are here to help you stop the invasion! ~
@3 = ~ Sir! Captain Nival We were informed that a large army was heading to the southern part of the city! ~
@4 = ~ I was afraid of that, I sent reinforcements there, but we suffered losses during the war with Luskan! Take one regiment into submission and advance to the southern walls, you will have to keep them! If the south wall falls, we are doomed! Go! ~

@0 = ~ <CHARNAME>, people from a neighboring village sent me here. I'm glad you're alive. Any news? ~
@1 = ~ Yes, I found the first magical relic as Grafalcon wanted it. I have a magic sphere. Gradak lost her when he teleported with the drow. ~
@2 = ~ Gradak, drow? ~
@3 = ~ Yes, Gradak was behind this attack on the village, I saw him talking to the red magicians. I remember exactly that I saw them before! ~
@4 = ~ Yes, the red magic used to be part of the magic council before the council broke up. We know the place where magicians take refuge. We think they have an old magician called Quarill. You need to check it out! Did you mention some dark elves ...? ~
@5 = ~ Yes, we were fighting Gradak when a group of dark elves suddenly appeared, two of them remained, and one teleported with Gradak. ~
@6 = ~ Gradak seems to be gaining allies everywhere. Warriors from the south, a guild of thieves from southeastern Faerûn, druids from the north are also on his side, and now there are even dark elves ... Hmm. Deal with the magicians, and I and Grafalkon will try to find out what is really happening. ~

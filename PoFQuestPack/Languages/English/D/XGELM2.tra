@1 = ~ <CHARNAME>, everything is bad, I would not like to drag you into this, but since you are here, you have to help me. ~
@2 = ~ What happened? ~
@3 = ~ Hradak appeared here yesterday, I thought he would surrender and help us stop the southerners, but on the contrary, the Council is at the same time with him and I still don't know exactly why, out of the entire High Savage of magicians, only a few are loyal to me. I will try to find out a little more, and you try to find my friends, and most importantly you have to get to the top floor, where there should be an archmage, the founder of a cult, find out what happened! If he is still alive. ~
@4 = ~ Okay, I'll try. Bye bye and stay my friend. ~

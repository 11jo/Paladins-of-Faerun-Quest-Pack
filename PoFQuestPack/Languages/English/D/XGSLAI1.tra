@1   = ~< CHARNAME > quickly here... They took him.~
@2   = ~Wait, I don't know who took who?~
@3   = ~Yarpen's warriors took my friend Solan...~
@4   = ~Good.. Do you know where he is now?~
@5   = ~Yes, two hours ago, Yarpen's servant came and gave me this card... And he told me that if I wanted to see Solan, I had to come there alone... But I know it's a trap... But maybe if you help me, we'll be able to stop him... I can join your party if you have a place for me, I'm an experienced Paladin...~
@6   = ~Paladins of Faerûn.

So now the legendary paladin Faerûna Slane has joined my party, and we have to save his friend if we want to defeat Sir Yarpen..~
@7   = ~Join us Slane... But we have to hurry, give me the map...~
@8   = ~Paladins of Faerûn.

Slane told me that his friend was captured by Yuzhan warriors and that we should save him... so he gave me a map... I have to go there and find him...~
@9   = ~I'm sorry, Slane, I don't have room for you... I'll find your other one I promise you... show me where this place is....~

@1 = ~ We met again <CHARNAME>, I'm glad you were here when your friend Grafalcon died from my sword! ~
@2 = ~ This fight was not fair Gradak! Your magicians have weakened his strength! Whenever we met, you always managed to slip away ... This time, you have nowhere to go. I will avenge Grafalkon and all those whom you killed. ~
@3 = ~ You ruined my plan to capture Faerûn <CHARNAME>! You will die for it! ~

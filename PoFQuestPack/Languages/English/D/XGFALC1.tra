@0 = ~ <CHARNAME>! What happened here? We spotted this Gradak camp, but unfortunately we did not find Gradak. Maybe you are more lucky? ~
@1 = ~ Yes and no. After we arrived at this camp, we came across Elminster. He asked me to stop searching for Gradak, but I did not. I came here and witnessed a conversation between Gradak and Elminster, they agreed on something. In the end, Elminster helped him escape. ~
@2 = ~ Elminster ... I don't think he will be on the side of Gradak, something should be behind it. We'll try to find out what's the matter, and you must pursue Gradak. ~
@3 = ~ I can't chase him if I don't know where he is. ~
@4 = ~ Perhaps he fled to his castle. I will mark this place on your map, so you need to follow there. I will contact you shortly. Bye. ~
@5 = ~ See you soon. ~
@6 = ~ Paladins of Faerûn.

I found Gradak's camp from which they attacked the cult. I saw Gradak talking with Elminster, they agreed on something. Grafalkon promised that he would find out what was happening, but he did not think that Elminster would be against us. My task is to get to the castle of Gradak, Grafalkon indicated its location on the map. ~

@0 = ~ <CHARNAME>, I'm glad I found you before it was too late. Hradak somehow found out about your arrival. The fortress to which you are heading in full combat readiness. Traps are installed everywhere. There is only one weak spot. Go through the dungeons there. ~
@1 = ~ How could he know about my arrival Alvin? Have you spoken to Grafalkon? ~
@2 = ~ I can't say how Gradak found out. Yes, I talked to Grafalkon. We both believe that Elminster has a plan to destroy Gradak, and we do not think that Elminster turned against us. He will never do it. ~
@3 = ~ Okay, I don't want to think about it. I'm just worried that he advised me to abandon this task, because it is dangerous and it was Elminster who himself hired me for this. ~
@4 = ~ We don't understand this either, but there seems to be something we don't even suspect. Therefore, I will teleport you to the entrance to the dungeons, and you try to find answers to the questions that we mentioned in this dialogue. Again, I wish you good luck, my friend. Bye. ~
@5 = ~ Goodbye Alvin and thanks. ~
@6 = ~ Paladins of Faerûn.

On the way to Gradak Castle, I was stopped by the wizard Alvin. He told me that Gradak knows about my arrival and protects all approaches, so he suggested using magic to transfer me to the dungeons leading to the Gradak fortress and then everything will depend only on me. I need to find out what's really going on. ~

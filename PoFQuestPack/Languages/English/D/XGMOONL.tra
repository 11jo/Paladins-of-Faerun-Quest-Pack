@1 = ~ So you just remained human. ~
@2 = ~ What are you talking about? ~
@3 = ~ One of my servants informed me of your arrival. He said he even warned you. And you decided to stay. What can I do for you? ~
@4 = ~ These mines are not yours. Get out of here, or you'll die. ~
@5 = ~ I have a suggestion for you, if you get rid of the dwarves and their leader Elgen, we will give you two precious items that we found in the mines. I dare say this is much more than what arrogant gnomes can offer you. ~
@6 = ~ I will not help you! ~

@1 = ~ <CHARNAME>, we don't have much time, no one should know about our conversation, otherwise they might kill me. ~
@2 = ~ Okay, let's quickly, I won't interrogate what you have for me? ~
@3 = ~ I know for sure that the ship was destroyed by one of the members of T. Luskanskaya (trading guild), not as a member of Neverwinter. Unfortunately, I don't see any point in this, why would Luskan destroy their own merchant ship? ~
@4 = ~ In our opinion, the Luskan merchant guild needed the patronage of the wars from Luskan, so it went with this ploy. Simply put, two merchant guilds in the same city can't get along. ~
@5 = ~ Therefore, you should get to the criminal as soon as possible. I can't just take you to our guild. You must find some other way. I'll take you to the docks. ~
@6 = ~ So, let's leave. ~

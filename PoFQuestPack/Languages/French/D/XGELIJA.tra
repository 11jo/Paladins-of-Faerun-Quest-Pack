@1 = ~ My brave warriors, today is the last day that southerners trample this land ... ~
@2 = ~ Prepare your weapons, my brothers, the last time we raise it. ~
@3 = ~ We are defenders, we were chosen to defend the cult of Faerûn, we must destroy the evil that invaded here in the heart of Féérune. ~
@4 = ~ What the hell? Who you are? Another southerner? But how did you find it, not a single southerner would pass through a secret passage? ~
@5 = ~ No, I do not belong to the southerners, I was sent by the advice of the magicians, namely Elwin. They wanted me to go through a secret passage and kill the leader of the southerners. ~
@6 = ~ Elwin sent you! So you can help us in our struggle? ~
@7 = ~ The fight? ~
@8 = ~ Do you see all these fighters? They have families ... but even so, they are here to maintain peace in Féérune. ~
@9 = ~ Well then, I will lead you to victory! ~
@10 = ~ I think you first need to find out who you are? ~
@11 = ~ I'm <CHARNAME>. I had to solve more complex problems than this. ~
@12 = ~ Divine child? Why didn't you say it right away? I will wait here until you kill Marco. ~
@13 = ~ Marco, who is he? ~
@14 = ~ Paladins of Féérune.

I arrived at the defenders of the Féérune cult. Elf Elijah the leader of the defenders wanted to start a battle with the soldiers of the southerners. I helped him lead the army into battle and my task was to stop Marco, the right hand of the leader of the southerners. And then get back to it. ~
@15 = ~ Marco, I will remember that name. Warriors get ready to go to battle! ~
@16 = ~ Marco the right hand of the southerners leader, if you stop him, the cult of Féérune will be free. ~
@17 = ~ I will find him and stop him! Warriors follow me! ~
@18 = ~ There are still survivors, I know this, we have to deal with them. ~
@19 = ~ So what do you decide? Will you let Marco run? ~
@20 = ~ Yes, I will, he will return to his family, and will not die here, although he was the leader's right hand, but he was not a warrior. I can't kill innocent people. ~
@21 = ~ So he was not guilty. He didn't say anything useful at all? ~
@22 = ~ He told me everything he knew ... Now I have to go through the portal that will lead me to Gradak. ~
@23 = ~ Gradak? He was a defender of the cult, one of the legendary paladins of Féérune ... And the most experienced of all. ~
@24 = ~ Maybe it was once, but you better prepare the rest of the troops and send them to the portal behind me. I will need help. ~
@25 = ~ Yes, I will send them to you as soon as possible, and I will also inform the High Council about our next step. And you follow Gradak. ~
@26 = ~ I hope we succeed. Bye. ~
@27 = ~ Well, now the southerners will be harder, Marco is finally dead, did he say something before his death? ~

@1 = ~ Greetings <CHARNAME>, I know why you came, you are looking for a place where the captors hold Quarill, the master of ancient magic. In addition, I must thank you for saving me from these annoying barbarians! I heard that this road to Bryn Sander belongs to them ... (Ha ha) ~
@2 = ~ Yes, Grafalkon sent me to you, he said that you can help me. ~
@3 = ~ Yes, yes, I will concentrate on this old man. It will take some time. ~
@4 = ~ ... ~
@5 = ~ Uh, yes, I see him. Quarill is currently in a frozen forest, this is the place on your map, and now I apologize, I need to relax a bit, goodbye and good luck. ~
@6 = ~ Paladins of Féérune.

The old magician was really peculiar, but he fulfilled his task and found the place where Qvarill abducted by Gradak is located. ~
@7 = ~ Thanks ... ~

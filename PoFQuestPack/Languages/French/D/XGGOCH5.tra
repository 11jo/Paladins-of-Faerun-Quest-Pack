@1 = ~ I see that you have dealt with all my predecessors. I will see if you have any strength left for me. Hradak would not have measured the fact that you came here. I do not understand, normal mortals would not succeed. Even when you entered, I felt that you were not just an adventurer. Who are you? ~
@2 = ~ My name is <CHARNAME> and I am a descendant of Baal. You felt right. I am the only one who can stop Gradak. But first I have to take care of you, I need your stone. ~
@3 = ~ Interesting. But you will not stop Hradak, because your adventure ends here. ~
@4 = ~ We'll take a look at that. ~

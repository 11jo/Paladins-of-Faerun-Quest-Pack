@0 = ~ I see we are late! Elwin sent us here! We will take care of all the other southerners! What is this ...? ~
@1 = ~ Glad to see you again <CHARNAME>, and who is it next to you? Is that you Elinar? Yes, yes, I remember you, you were the security commander on the Council. You must follow my orders! ~
@2 = ~ No, we are now serving Elwin, the new head of the Council of Mages! We thought that <CHARNAME> killed you! It doesn't matter, now I will destroy you Tassili! ~
@3 = ~ <CHARNAME> just killed my double. But I do not think that this is the right moment to settle accounts. One of the Gradak armies landed in Neverwinter. I believe that after the fight with Luskan, they have little chance of holding out for a long time, and Gradak will soon get the Neverwinter. The city has strategic importance, from it you can step on Waterdeep and the already mentioned Luskan. <CHARNAME> and you all cannot stop it! ~
@4 = ~ <CHARNAME>, here we can do it ourselves, and you go to Neverwinter and help them keep this city! ~

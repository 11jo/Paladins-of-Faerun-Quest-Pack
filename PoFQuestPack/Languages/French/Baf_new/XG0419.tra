@0 = ~ Brother, was it necessary to fight those elves? As you know, we don't have much time, I need to combine these magical relics ... ~
@1 = ~ Yes, yes, but there is one problem, I can't perform the ritual without knowing ancient magic ... You have to go north, to Decapolis, and find an old magician named Quarill there. ~
@2 = ~ We will go together brother! ~
@3 = ~ No. Go away immediately, someone is coming here ... ~
@4 = ~ Hmm! Elves again? It's strange that the battle in the village taught you nothing! ~
@5 = ~ We are here to avenge our captain, prepare for death, traitor! ~
@6 = ~ Aren't you funny yourself? Weapons won't help you! ~
@7 = ~ <CHARNAME>! First of all, you and your company, I have to thank you for saving us from the traitor Tassili, already the second in a row ... In addition, Gradak found out about your success in Neverwinter, gathered an army, invaded the territory of the Decapolis, and the present is moving towards Targos ... We at the Council believe that his attack on the Decapolis has deeper reasons, maybe he is looking for something. You can stop him, immediately advance on the ship to Targos and stop him once and for all! You are our only hope! ~

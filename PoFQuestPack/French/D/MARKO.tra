@1 = ~ I was waiting for you, my scouts reported to me that you are trying to kill our leader Gradak, is that so? ~
@2 = ~ Yes, Marco. Your tyranny ends here in this holy place. You cannot escape. You are surrounded. ~
@3 = ~ Maybe, but I don’t want to fight you. I am not a warrior, I am only the messenger of Hradak. ~
@4 = ~ So order your warriors to lay down their arms and surrender. ~
@5 = ~ I cannot do this, but if you allow me to return to my family, I will tell you all the information about Gradak that I have. ~
@6 = ~ Anything Gradak did in exchange for your freedom? I see that this is a good exchange. Tell me everything and you can go. ~
@7 = ~ I have a diary behind me, it has everything you need, but be careful, my Mr. Gradak knows about you and awaits your arrival. ~
@8 = ~ Thanks for the info, you can go. ~
@9 = ~ Thank you, but I can’t let you live, this is too much risk. ~

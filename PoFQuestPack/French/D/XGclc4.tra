@0 = ~ Welcome to the sanctuary of our god Cyric, built largely thanks to you, <CHARNAME>. Good to see you again. ~
@1 = ~ And I am glad, high priest. Why did you send for me? ~
@2 = ~ Sorry <CHARNAME> that I am bothering you again, but I have one assignment. Torm priests poison our lives again, and at this moment you are the only one who can save us from them once and for all. ~
@3 = ~ I'm really sorry, but right now I donâ€™t have time to work for you. Maybe later. ~
@4 = ~ And what is it? ~
@5 = ~ Far to the north of here in the frozen plains is an island, and under it should be a very valuable historical scroll. A hidden secret about the confrontation between Torm and Cyric. And yet - we learned that admirers of Torm sent their group of adventurers to find this scroll. ~
@6 = ~ And what do we need to do for the high priest? ~
@7 = ~ I need this scroll. I will give you a map that will lead you to the place where it is. ~
@8 = ~ Okay, I'll do it. ~
@9 = ~ Order and chaos.

The battle continues. The high priest of Cyric called us again, this time to find the lost scroll. He gave us a map that will lead us to the treasure. A group of treasure seekers hired by Torm's priests also set off for the scroll. ~
@10 = ~ Are you back? Do you want to help me? ~
@11 = ~ Yes, but what's the matter? ~
@12 = ~ Not now, I'm leaving. ~
@13 = ~ Do you have a scroll? ~
@14 = ~ Not yet. ~
@15 = ~ Yes, I have this scroll. ~
@16 = ~ Great job. I did not even expect that we could ever achieve all this! The circus is grateful to you! You have done much more than you can imagine. For your dedicated service, I will bestow this item on you and you can choose one of these blessings. Your choice? ~
@17 = ~ Constitution. ~
@18 = ~ Order and chaos.

Using the map, you managed to find an old scroll. Now you must return to the high priest. ~
@19 = ~ Order and chaos.

The storyline is over. (For the adherents of Cyric) ~
@20 = ~ Intelligence. ~
@21 = ~ Wisdom. ~

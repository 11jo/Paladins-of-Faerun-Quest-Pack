@1 = ~ Welcome to our little village friends, what can I do for you? My name is Rolard, I'm kind of the manager of this village. ~
@2 = ~ We would like to relate Rolard, is there such an opportunity? ~
@3 = ~ We have to restock, is there a blacksmith here? ~
@4 = ~ I apologize, we made a mistake at home. ~
@5 = ~ We are looking for a man named Gradak. It was supposed to be held here recently! Do you remember him? ~
@6 = ~ Yes, of course I understand. To the north-east of my house is a local tavern, there you will definitely be offered an overnight stay. Do you want anything else? ~
@7 = ~ No thanks. ~
@8 = ~ When you leave my house and go southwest, you will be taken to a local blacksmith. ~
@9 = ~ Thanks Rolard ~
@10 = ~ Something else you want? ~
@11 = ~ Yes, there was a stranger here, he stopped only for one night, then he left. ~
@12 = ~ And you do not know where he went? ~
@13 = ~ I'm not interested in questions about every stranger if he leaves our village anyway. ~
@14 = ~ This stranger we are talking about gathered an army of southerners, destroyed almost the entire cult of the Paladins of Féérune, killed many people, and even attacked the two cities of Féérune, Neverwinter and Targos. Our task is to find it and stop it, so if you know anything, tell us! ~
@15 = ~ My God, we treated him like a venerable paladin! Three days ago, I sent scouts north-east of our village. There are camps of orcs. There was never a big problem with them. And now, one of my scouts saw people among them, probably magicians. This is pretty unusual ... ~
@16 = ~ Paladins of Féérune.

The Ranger Rolard saw Gradak, but he only stayed there one night, and then set off north of the village. There are camps of orcs. Scouts from the village saw that among them were magicians in red robes, whom we had already met once. Maybe he is collecting a ritual and wants to combine these 3 relics, we should get there as soon as possible. Rolard marked us this place on the map. ~
@17 = ~ Hello to you from Gradak! ~
@18 = ~ This is it! He already sent these magicians in red robes to me once. Mark me this place on the map. We will go there immediately. ~
@19 = ~ Have you returned for some information? ~

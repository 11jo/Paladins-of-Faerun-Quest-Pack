@1 = ~ So you appeared, and I already thought that you would not come, <CHARNAME>. My name is Alvin, I am the envoy of the Council of Mages located near the Snowy Mountains. ~
@2 = ~ Council of Mages? What it is? I have never heard of him. ~
@3 = ~ This is not surprising, with the exception of its members, no one knows about this place. At this point there are magicians who are responsible for the safety of all of Faerýn. ~
@4 = ~ And what do I have to do with it? If you are as powerful as you say, then why do you need me, an ordinary adventurer? ~
@5 = ~ You are not quite an ordinary adventurer, <CHARNAME>, you are the hero of Faer ,n, do you think we know nothing about you? Iron throne, fortress of gnols, Gate of Baldur, death of your brother Sarevok, do you remember this? You have helped many people in Féérune. For many cities you are a hero. For enemies a threat. As for power, we have power, but we are not warriors and adventurers, so we need you. You have been selected for one task. ~
@6 = ~ Do you say task? What other task? ~
@7 = ~ You were chosen to defend the ritual during which a new order will be created to defend Féérune. ~
@8 = ~ Why me? And why do you need protection? ~
@9 = ~ Look for someone else, I'm not a guardian. ~
@10 = ~ Your friend Elminster, if you can call him that, recommended you and thanks to your heroic actions, the council agreed. This ritual is very important for Féérune, a very powerful spell will be performed on it, and the one on whom it will be used will be invincible, not a single person can kill it, now you understand why we chose you? ~
@11 = ~ Does this mean that if something goes wrong, should I kill him? ~
@12 = ~ You must be there <CHARNAME> if something goes wrong. None of us can stop him. No magic will destroy him. ~
@13 = ~ But I really can't, I have to find the magician who kidnapped Imoyen. ~
@14 = ~ Yes, but you will find out more details on the spot from Elminster, I’m only a messenger who should transmit this information. ~
@15 = ~ Well, when do I need to be there? Where is this place? ~
@16 = ~ If possible, as soon as possible. The preparation is almost complete, but without you the ritual will not begin. Show me the map, I will mark this place. ~
@17 = ~ I will try to go there as soon as possible, but I have an urgent matter. ~
@18 = ~ I know what bothers you, Imoen and Irenicus. But it has to wait. You must go to this place and defend the ritual. ~
@19 = ~ How do you know that? Do you know who this Irenicus is? And where is Imoyen? ~
@20 = ~ I cannot tell you anything specific, but I am authorized to assist you. I know that someone Gaelan contacted you and offered you help for 20,000. I think you should accept his offer. This gave you advice, provided that you accept this task. ~
@21 = ~ Paladins of Féérune.

The Council of Mages sent an envoy to Alvin, asking for help. He explained to me why I was chosen to defend the ritual, during which a new order would be created to defend Féérune. I also found out that they know about Irenicus and Imoen, the Council sends me 20,000 for Gaelin, and so I can return Imoen, I need to go to this place. ~
@22 = ~ Obviously, I have to go there and personally thank the advice. Thanks Alvin, I hope we meet again. Bye. ~
@23 = ~ Of course, I expected this, we know about it, and I am ready to help you if you help us. ~
@24 = ~ Why did you choose me? ~

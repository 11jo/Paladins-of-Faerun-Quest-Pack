@1 = ~ <Probably you are CHARNAME>, the one who constantly disrupts my master’s plans? Everywhere you appear like some kind of savior, but what do you have from this? Are you getting a reward or something else? ~
@2 = ~ Elwin is our friend, and we do not leave our friends ... Tell Gradak that we miss him, and for now, at least part of the paladin that he has been named for lives in him, let him meet me face to face. Now let go of Elwin. ~
@3 = ~ I think you don’t have to deal with him, I was trained by Gradak himself and I will not run away from the battle! Fight against me, and if you win, your friend Elwin will be free, and if not, I will personally leave your head to my master! ~
@4 = ~ If you want to die for your master, so be it! ~

@0 = ~ Mayor. I'm glad you accepted me. I am here as a follower of Cyric. I know that you await the arrival of caravans with the priests of Torm. But the Cyricists do not want a temple to stand here. Your daughter will be with us until you give permission to build the Temple of Cyric. I hope you make the right choice. If someone comes with a caravan, drive them out of the city. ~
@1 = ~ But you have to pay for the land somehow. I can't just give her away. ~
@2 = ~ Of course. Here is the treasury. Pay her for the land. If there are no complications, we will return your daughter. Bye. ~

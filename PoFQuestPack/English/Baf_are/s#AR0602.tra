@0 = ~ They said you wanted to talk to me, Khalid. So what's bothering you? Don't you like your cell? ~
@1 = ~ No, I want to know what you want an elf from us? Why are we imprisoned, and why do you need our friend <CHARNAME>? ~
@2 = ~ Haha, you're just a pawn in my game. I will kill you as soon as I receive power from <CHARNAME>. He does not understand what destructive power is in him. I have a lot, and I want to rule over all of Faer√ªn. Control! Torture him more and more, he must tell us something useful, and then kill him and others, the next will be the girl Imoyen. ~
@3 = ~ Yes, sir. It will be fulfilled, sir. ~
@4 = ~ (I need to quickly find <CHARNAME>, poor Khalid, maybe he can take a little time, where can there be <CHARNAME>?) ~
@5 = ~ I will not let you torture me, I am Khalid, an elven warrior, to arms! ~
@6 = ~ Nooo, I have to get out of here, I hope others are still alive, I have to save them! ~

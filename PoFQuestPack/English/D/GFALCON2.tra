We defeated all the members of the council of magicians in the main room, where we encountered Archmage Tasilla. We learned that Gradak was his brother, and that all this had been planned in advance. He talked about the army of southerners and 3 magic relics. After his death, Grafalcon appeared here, he sent me and my group to find one of those relics on the Sword Coast. We must find her before Gradak does. ~
@7 = ~ Okay, see you later. Bye. ~

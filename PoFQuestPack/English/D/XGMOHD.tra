@1 = ~ <CHARNAME> glad to see you here, so the courier has sent you our message. Hradak is at the top, he killed the representative of the Council and is now fighting with Grafalkon. Unfortunately, he has little chance, because with Gradak there are two powerful magicians, they can cast a weakening spell on Grafalkon. You must intervene immediately. I know the shortest path, with it you will get much faster than if you had to go through all the floors teeming with southerners. ~
@2 = ~ Alright, take me to Gradak! Alvin and the cult soldiers will take care of the southerners. They will be here any minute! ~

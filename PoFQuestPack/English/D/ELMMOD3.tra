We defeated all the members of the council of magicians in the main room, where we encountered Tasilla, the archmage. We learned that Gradak is his brother, and that all this was planned. He talked about the army of southerners and 3 magic relics. After his death, Grafalcon appeared here, he sent me and my group to find one of those relics on the Sword Coast, we must find it before Gradak does it. ~
@7 = ~ Okay, see you later. Bye. ~

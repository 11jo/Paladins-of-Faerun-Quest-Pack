@1 = ~ What did he do? Why are you imposing him on a killer? ~
@2 = ~ Don't you see these dead? These are our sisters! He killed them all, this is one of the killers! We do not approve of violence, but we must avenge our sister! ~
@3 = ~ I don’t have time for this, so go and see your sisters! ~
@4 = ~ Wait, calm down everything! I do not think it was Dhaerovatil, he is too young and has never fought a drow. Will you let me see everything here? ~
@5 = ~ Good, but fast! ~
@6 = ~ So you were right. But not me! Well, your friend is free, goodbye. ~

@1 = ~ What do you want in my store? I’m not selling you anything unless you have a mage license ... ~
@2 = ~ I am <CHARNAME> and I was sent to you by the high priest of Escadul ... Here is the license ... ~
@3 = ~ Hm, so I see you are looking for an old wizard ... I don’t know if I should help you ... but the high priest of Squadula is a good friend of mine and I will tell you that I know ... ~
@4 = ~ You are very lucky today ... The old wizard went to the local tavern ... He rented a room there for the night .. Go to the owner and tell him that you are going to visit the old magician, he will lead you to him .. Goodbye .. ~
@5 = ~ A castle that does not exist.

I gave the document to the merchant magician, and he sent me to a local hotel ... I have to talk to the innkeeper and he will take me to the old wizard. ~
@6 = ~ Thank you merchant ... ~

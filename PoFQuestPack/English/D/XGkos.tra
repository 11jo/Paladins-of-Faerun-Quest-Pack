@1 = ~ Welcome to my forge, <SIRMAAM>. I think you look like a serious person. And most likely, you need a blacksmith. Good. I can offer you something if you want. I sell standard items purchased from Shivarasovâ€™s priests, that is, spears, bows, long swords, and the like. ~
@2 = ~ Well, let's see what you have. ~
@3 = ~ No thanks, I'll go. ~
@4 = ~ Of course. Choose, don't be shy if you want. ~
@5 = ~ Good. Goodbye, <SIRMAAM>. ~

@0 = ~ I'm glad to welcome you here <CHARNAME>, and also glad that you accepted our offer. Elminster said you are the best and you can be trusted. That's why we chose you. I know that you are busy, and you have little time for this. ~
@1 = ~ As we both know, the enemies of Faeríàn are becoming stronger, so we need protection. Today we are going to create a cult that will protect Faerun. ~
@2 = ~ Cult? What kind of cult is this? ~
@3 = ~ This will be the cult of the paladins. We called on the best and most loyal paladins from all over Faerýn to become members of this cult today. Many of them accepted the offer. Today we are choosing two leaders. These leaders will be endowed with magical powers. ~
@4 = ~ What kind of magical power are you talking about? ~
@5 = ~ He who is endowed with this power will receive immortality and inhuman power. No one can kill him. ~
@6 = ~ Nobody? There is probably a way to defeat him if he wants to use this power against the cult. ~
@7 = ~ Therefore, two leaders are elected. If one turns against us, the second will have to stop him. But there’s another option that I haven’t told you about. ~
@8 = ~ I'm listening. ~
@9 = ~ The reason you are here is not only because you are one of the best. The real reason is that the one who is endowed with magical power can only be stopped by the one in whom the divine blood flows. And that is you, son of Baal. ~
@10 = ~ Now you know everything, let me know when you are ready. ~
@11 = ~ I'll be back as soon as possible. I need to finish a couple of things. ~
@12 = ~ Paladins of Faeríàn.

From a conversation with the founder of a new cult to defend Faeríàn, I learned that this was not an accident, and I was chosen on purpose. My task is for everything to go smoothly. ~
@13 = ~ I am ready. We can start immediately. ~
@14 = ~ Are you ready? ~
@15 = ~ I need a little time. ~

@1 = ~ Well, you deserve to fight me <CHARNAME>! ~
@2 = ~ If you do not want to die, tell me where I can find Gradak! ~
@3 = ~ Okay, I'll tell you where to look for him, even if you think it's better to give up before it's too late. But first, promise that you will accept my challenge, and we will fight one on one, only you and me! ~
@4 = ~ Well, I agree, and now say everything you know! ~
@5 = ~ Gradak recently came to me, or rather, came for my magical relic. He wanted me to leave with him, but I did not agree, I needed to take care of my students ... ~
@6 = ~ But now I do not have students, so I will fight with you, but before this happens, I will mark on your map the location of Gradak's shelter. It's right here ... ~
@7 = ~ Thank you, do you still insist on the battle? ~
@8 = ~ Yes, I insist ... If you win, so be it! ~
@9 = ~ Paladins of Faeríàn.

I found out where Gradak was hiding, but first I had to go back to the city and owe it to the duke that this group would no longer bother him. ~

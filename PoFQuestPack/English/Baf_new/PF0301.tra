@0 = ~ Thank you for saving my friends, I would like to give you something special, but I only have gold with me. Thanks again. ~
@1 = ~ The stolen.

I met in the cave of a damned forest a warrior who claims that he escaped from a dungeon in the forest, and his friends were abducted by dark creatures. The time has come to find the source of darkness, it must be somewhere underground. ~
@2 = ~ Kidnapped. After the creatures died, I found Sir William's friends, they all went to him. ~

@0 = ~ Not one person has yet managed to withstand me in a battle against Grafalkon. And you need wizards to weaken me. You are a shame on advice! ~
@1 = ~ The only thing that will save you from my revenge is only if I kill you all, you, Alvin, all members of the cult and that adventurer who ruined all my plans! ~
@2 = ~ Nooo! Gradak, you will die! ~
@3 = ~ <CHARNAME>! Glad to see you safe and sound. What's with Gradak? Did you kill him? ~
@4 = ~ Yes. Gradak will never harm anyone. ~
@5 = ~ Great job. I'm sorry you were involved in this. But you were the only one who could kill him. No one else could compete with him. I still have a lot to do, maybe someday see you again! Good luck on your wanderings <CHARNAME>! ~
@6 = ~ Perhaps you could not even think that I would survive! ~
@7 = ~ Alvin, is that you? We already decided that you gave your life to save the Sword Coast. ~
@8 = ~ Yes, it's a pity that this happened to Grafalkon. No matter how sad it is. It was one of the best paladins with a great future. And Gradak? Who would know that he is so striving for power. I have known him for over 15 years. I would never have believed that he could do such a thing until I saw it myself. ~
@9 = ~ But that doesn't matter. Everything is over. Gradak and Grafalkon are no longer with us. Two of the best, and what was created as a new cult to protect the Sword Coast, failed. In fact, I believe that such an order cannot exist, everyone will strive for power. ~
@10 = ~ Try to create it again after a while? ~
@11 = ~ Maybe <CHARNAME>. Maybe sometime in the future. We may need your help again. But in the end, you did a great job. I have a reward for you. During my travels, I collected five very powerful artifacts. Now they are yours. ~
@12 = ~ Thanks again for helping you and your friends. Now I am teleporting you to Brinnlow, I know that you are looking for an elven sorcerer. So, I wish you good luck. Bye. ~
@13 = ~ Paladins of Faerûn. The story ends. Hradak, who betrayed his two friends Alvin and Grafalkon, is now dead, along with the hero Grafalkon. A new order of the Knights of Faerûn was not created. And as Alvin said, it may never arise because there is not a single person, elf, or anyone else who would not want to gain such power that he could conquer the whole world. ~

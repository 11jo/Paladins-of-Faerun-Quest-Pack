@0 = ~ Welcome to our adventurer, under normal circumstances, I would probably guide you and show you our best products, but this is not the right time ... We are here for a different one, right, my friend? ~
@1 = ~ Of course, but I'm not a friend to you, we barely know each other. Who the hell are you? And why am I here? ~
@2 = ~ So let me introduce myself, I'm the leader of the Neverwinter trade guild and I sent this for you, because we have a common enemy. ~
@3 = ~ Hm, you think you're talking about the Luscan Trade Guild? ~
@4 = ~ You guessed the adventurer, for two months now they have sent killers to us and steal our goods. It must be stopped! ~
@5 = ~ Don't be offended, but I don't want to interfere in disputes between the Neverwinter guilds. ~
@6 = ~ I think I have no choice. I am the only one who can penetrate their guild. ~
@7 = ~ Well, I'm glad to hear ... How much will it cost me? ~
@8 = ~ I have two tasks for you before you get into the guild and one will be in the guild itself. When you are ready, come to me. ~

@0 = ~ You again disappointed me Grafalkon ... goodbye! And you Quarill will come with me! ~
@1 = ~ No, Grafalkon, help me! ~
@2 = ~ <CHARNAME>, he escaped from us again, but I know that he is looking for an old magician. Fortunately, I discovered that one such magical magician still lives in the Valley of the Ice Wind. When you find him, he will be able to use magic to find the place where abducted Quarill is located. ~
@3 = ~ You have to hurry, time is against us. Hradak should not combine the three relics, you must get them, and then destroy them! Depart through the north gate from Targos and follow to Bryn Sander! When you stumble upon an old hut, this is your goal. Good luck, we'll meet again soon! ~

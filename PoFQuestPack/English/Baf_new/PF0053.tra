@0 = ~ Everything is here, let the ritual begin! ~
@1 = ~ Sir Gradak, you were chosen as one of the two leaders of the newly created cult to defend Faeríàn. Swear that you will protect the cult and all its members. ~
@2 = ~ I swear. ~
@3 = ~ Finally, I have the power! And you thought that I would serve you! Now all of Faerín will fall at my feet! (whistle) ~
@4 = ~ <CHARNAME> we were attacked! Stop Gradak! ~
@5 = ~ <CHARNAME>, I managed to find out where these soldiers came from. Perhaps in the same place you will find Gradak. You must kill him, or all Faeríón will come to an end. Get ready, now I will transfer you to this place. ~

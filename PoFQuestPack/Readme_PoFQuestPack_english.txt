     Description

The PoFQuestPack mod is a WeiDU processing of the total conversion of Paladins of Faerun from BGslayer and other Czech developers, and contains only the quests of the original Paladins of Faerun.
In Weidu, the mod format was translated by Gorion and Serdrick. The PoFQuestPack mod contains all the quests of the Paladins of Faerun mod, but it is not an exact copy of it. Part of the quests was implemented differently. A large number of errors were also corrected, many scripts and dialogs were rewritten practically anew.

     Installation

Standard for WeiDU mods. For the mod, SOA + TOB + the latest patch is required. Unzip the contents of the archive into the directory with the game, and run SETUP-PoFQuestPack.exe.
After installing the mod, be sure to install the BP-BGT-Worlmap mod, without which you will not see new mod locations.

     Content

The mod contains with itself 1 large main quest "Paladins of Faerun", 2 side quests "Order and Chaos" and "Abduction and Politics". New adventures in the cities are also waiting for you: Neverwinter, Baldur's Gate, Waterdeep, Targos (city center, docks), Siluvaned (Elven city) and Har Al-Dur (city of priests) - each of them has its own city quest, mainly to provide any help to the city or even save it. In addition, there are more than 20 separate small quests.

    Thanks
